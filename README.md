# fcc-progress
Just keeping track of my progress through fCC. Start and end times merely reflect how long it has taken to do each task and does not account for extracurricular studies into each section.\
This is currently housing all the Responsive Web Design tasks. I will make a new repo for the next modules as and when I reach them.\

**Learn html by building a cat photo app:**\
Started 30/12/24 ~8pm\
Finished 31/12/24 12pm\

\
**Learn basic css by building a cafe menu:**\
Started 31/12/24 1pm\

\
**Learn CSS colours:**\
Started 1/1/25 4:30pm\
Finished 1/1/25 6:15pm\

_I like how quickly we've moved into css, lots of this information is still familiar to me from around 2006-9, so it's all been pretty simple so far._\
\

Started 2/1/25 11am\
Finished 4/1/25 1:20pm\

Started 12/1/25 11:30pm\
Finished 12/1/25 3:30am\
\
_This one was fun; I have found that the cert proj's are more engaging when I make the content as lame/funny as I can. And in doing so, I have found that I retain the information better._\
\
**Learn the CSS Box Model by Building a Rothko Painting**\
Started 13/1/25 12am\
Finished 13/1/25 12:30am\
\

Finished 18/1/25 2pm\
_Took my time with this one, wanted to get as close to the example page as possible; not sure I succeeded, but I am happy with what I produced. Also, it's Simpsons related, so how can I go wrong, right?_\
\
**Build a Travel Agency Page**\
Started 19/1/25 9pm\
Finished 19/1/25 10:30pm\
\
_I have begun to dip into the Full-Stack Cert projects for extra learning, so I am pleased to find a lot more projects like this._
_Initially lost what I had done, but managed to re-write quite quickly. Easy task, good memory exercise. Happy to incorporate my love for Medieval Italian Poetry._\
\
**Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz**\
Started 6/2/25 1pm\
Finished 6/2/25 4pm\
\
_Took a couple of weeks off due to work, so I wanted to get started again with FCC and not lose too much motivation. Not a huge fan of building this one, the work dragged and I couldn't wait to finish, but that is probablt just having to dust off the rust from not doing any of the work at all. Still motivated._\
\
**Learn More About CSS Pseudo Selectors by Building a Balance Sheet**\
Started 10/2/25 11am\
Finished 10/2/25 5:30pm\
\
_Again, took my time with this one, lots of useful information regarding pseudo selectors that I have made a note of and will refer back to this one in future. Quite a bit, I expect._\
\
**Learn Intermediate CSS by Building a Cat Painting**\
Started 12/2/25 8pm\
Finished 14/2/25 7:30pm\
\
_Decent exercise here, I really enjoyed the way the tutorial parsed everything repeatedly to ensure comprehensive coverage and forming a knowledge base. Wish I had done this in one single session to make my notes more involved, but this was split over 2 days because of my work commitments._\
\

Started 14/2/25 8:30pm\
Finished 14/2/25 9pm\
