# fcc-progress
Just keeping track of my progress through fCC. Start and end times merely reflect how long it has taken to do each task and does not account for extracurricular studies into each section.\
This is currently housing all the Responsive Web Design tasks. I will make a new repo for the next modules as and when I reach them.\

**Learn CSS colours:**\
Started 1/1/25 4:30pm\
Finished 1/1/25 6:15pm\

Started 12/1/25 11:30pm\
Finished 12/1/25 3:30am\

\
